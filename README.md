# odin-project-battleship
VERSION 1.0

Created to test out TDD and getting familiar with writing test (JK i wrote like 5 test and ignore it for the rest of the development...)

Feature:
- Intense battle (square clicking action)
- Dragable UI (most of the them)
- Battle against very smart CPU (RNG init bruv)
- Clean UI design (lazy)

Roadmap (If i did not forget about the project):
- PvP 
- Sound Design and Music
- More interactivity
- Multiple CPU difficulty
- Single Player Campaign (hell nah bruv)
